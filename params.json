I mistakenly bought a bunch of these thinking they were NRF24L01's\r\nin the beginning of 2015 and decided to start building a software stack\r\nfor them.  \r\n\r\nCoupled with some Pro Mini's and patience, I built a mesh network stack \r\nbased on these little radios. \r\n\r\n# Building The Code #\r\nThe example sketches are all based on building with [arscons](https://github.com/suapapa/arscons).\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a few caveats. Namely, the code expects an Arduino distribution in the resources/\r\ndirectory. One is included, but needs to be unpacked first:\r\n` cd resources/ ; unzip arduino-1.6.1-linux32.tar.xz\r\n\r\nTo build the current sketch (atmega_a7105.ino), type:\r\n` scons\r\n\r\nTo clean:\r\n` scons -c\r\n\r\nTo upload to your board:\r\n` scons upload\r\n\r\nNote, check out the arscons page and update your arscons.json configuration file if\r\nyou aren't running a 5V 16Mhz Pro Mini via a FTDI programmer as I am.\r\n\r\n# Debugging Your Nodes #\r\n\r\nTo enable serial debugging output in the library, just uncomment the line:\r\n` //#define A7105_MESH_DEBUG\r\n\r\nThis will output internal state and received packet dumps to help diagnose problems.\r\n\r\nThere is also a script (one liner) in the repository called \"serial_mon.sh\", running it fires \r\nup screen and archives the output to screenlog.0\r\n` ./serial\\_mon.sh /dev/ttyUSB0  \r\n \r\n# Examples #\r\nI included a few simple example sketches to use when you're getting started with the\r\ncode. These are pretty simple and probably not very useful.\r\n\r\n# Mesh Network Structure #\r\nCheck out /notes/mesh.markdown for an overview of the mesh network features and packet structures.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
