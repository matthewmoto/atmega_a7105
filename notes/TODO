* Add notes to documentation about repeating JOIN packets regardless of whether
  we've repeated them before (the special case we added).

* Propagate the callback syntax changes (adding extra parameter) to the arguments
  of all the other entry-point functions.

* Add notes to docs about running multiple radio nodes requiring you to specify
  your own callback or only the the requesting radio will process any network
  traffic during the request.

* Start thinking about ways to gaurantee uniqueness for the unique_id's

* Flesh out the remainder of the PACKET types and requests once the Mesh is
  working with JOIN, PING, CONFLICT_NAME and GET_NUM_REGISTERS
