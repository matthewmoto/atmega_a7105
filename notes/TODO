* Add notes to docs about running multiple radio nodes requiring you to specify
  your own callback or only the the requesting radio will process any network
  traffic during the request.

* Start thinking about ways to gaurantee uniqueness for the unique_id's
  Idea: Look for packets with a different node-id and the same unique-ID and 
        send a new type of conflict packet.
    
        This would work because node-id's are regulated so unless you're both 
        already joined as the same node ID, one will get bounced and get a 
        different node-id on join. Thusly, it's a good chance you can catch
        an identical unique ID.

        The behavior would probably be an interrupting re-join on the lower
        node id (since we wouldn't notice if they were identical).  

        NOTE: we'll also have to disable our unique_ID filtering for the 
              pending operation if there is one when we do this so we don't 
              miss data.

* Flesh out the remainder of the PACKET types and requests once the Mesh is
  working with JOIN, PING, CONFLICT_NAME and GET_NUM_REGISTERS

* After the Mesh is working, look for ways to reduce the size of the 
  generated HEX file, things are starting to get big...
